Write a simple pet, that perform very little but die slowly but surely.
As the times goes, write more feature to automatically heal itself (search for food, looks for friends, escape hostile creatures...)

Rules:
- every new feature must have a downside that will make the pet die until we create the next one.


The pet should be rendered in an image, that is able to be displayed in a browser, and sync'd every x seconds.
